German to English Translator (PyTorch from Scratch)

Python 3.10 | PyTorch 2.0

Overview

This project implements a German-to-English translator entirely from scratch using PyTorch, based on the Transformer architecture from "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017).

The model is trained on parallel German-English corpora and supports interactive sentence translation, as well as programmatic translation from Python scripts.

Key Features:

Full Transformer implementation: Encoder, Decoder, Multi-Head Attention, Positional Encoding

Tokenized input using SpaCy

Label Smoothing for stable training

Noam Optimizer for learning rate scheduling

Educational implementation without any pre-trained models
